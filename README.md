## ‚ú® My Focus: Actionable Lab Design

Welcome to my portfolio, where the "code" is curriculum and the "applications" are hands-on labs. I specialize in translating complex middleware and cloud-native concepts into **actionable, high-impact learning experiences** that transform learners into proficient administrators and architects.

Over the past year, I have been intensely dedicated to **refining my methodology for technical curriculum development**. This commitment involves ensuring lab environments are consistently reproducible, easily scalable, and grounded in real-world use cases, significantly **improving the overall presence and effectiveness of the learning material**.
