## ‚ú® My Focus: Bridging Theory and Practice

Welcome to my professional profile. I'm **Leonardo**, a dedicated **Instructional Designer** and **Technical Curriculum Developer** specializing in complex enterprise integration and cloud-native technologies. My strengths lie in articulating technical concepts to diverse audiences and fostering a culture of continuous learning.

My recent work has been focused on translating my deep domain knowledge‚Äîspecifically in **IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE)**, **IBM MQ**, and **IBM Red Hat OpenShift**‚Äîinto **actionable, hands-on labs** and courseware for business partners and clients.

Over the past year, I have also been dedicated to **improving my presence and approach as a code writer**. This commitment includes applying my backend expertise to modern web development by building a series of **Django projects** of late, ensuring my development skills remain current and robust.

## üìö Core Curriculum Development: Enterprise Integration

I design comprehensive learning experiences that empower clients to achieve a competitive advantage and create market disruptions. My curriculum focuses on real-world scenarios across the IBM integration portfolio.

### 1. IBM App Connect Enterprise (ACE) Development

[cite_start]I create modules, like the two-day "IBM App Connect Enterprise 12 Application Development I" course, that teach experienced specialists and senior-level developers how to construct message flow applications[cite: 236, 240, 254].

**Key Learning Objectives:** Developing, deploying, and testing message flow applications; creating reusable subflows; and developing and testing **REST APIs**.
**Hands-On Focus:** Exercises include importing and testing message flows using the **Flow Exerciser** [cite: 292, 293][cite_start], creating custom message flow applications, adding flow control, and developing a REST API using the OpenAPI Editor[cite: 318, 319].

### 2. IBM MQ and Cloud-Native Integration

While the provided document focuses heavily on ACE, my work extends to:

* **IBM MQ:** Designing labs for administering and securing enterprise messaging systems.
* **IBM Red Hat OpenShift:** Developing exercises for containerizing and managing integration assets within the Kubernetes environment, often leveraging OpenShift Operators for deployment.

## üíª Recent Projects: Python and Django

In addition to my curriculum work, I am actively engaging in modern development to keep my coding skills sharp.

* **Focus:** Leveraging my **Python** expertise to build structured and scalable applications using the **Django** framework.
* [cite_start]**Goal:** To enhance my understanding of contemporary **Technical Leadership** and deliver new, complex solutions effectively[cite: 210, 213].

## üí° Professional Experience and Interests

Beyond curriculum and coding, I apply my skills as a **Change Agent** and leader in technology.

**Curriculum & Technical Background:** I have **16 years of experience** in teaching and E-learning [cite: 217][cite_start], having taught subjects like **Computational Thinking**, **Java**, **Python**, and **AP Computer Science**.
**Teamwork & Quality Assurance:** I co-hosted monthly Automation Round Table sessions, curating presentations and managing the agenda, which saved significant development time. I also assisted in a **Learning Management System migration** by evaluating courses, reporting detailed bugs, and testing security modules.
**Creative Solutions:** I am interested in analyzing new situations to implement solutions and develop new system elements, procedures, or processes to provide better products for all stakeholders.
